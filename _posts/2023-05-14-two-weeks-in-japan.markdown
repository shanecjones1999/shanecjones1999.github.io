## Post in progress

Come back soon for updates!

#### Editor's note

While this trip occurred in December 2022, actually writing this post has escaped me and I am only getting around to doing this in August, 2024, nearly 2 years later. Sadly, I am likely to miss many great details of the trip. While I am sad this is the case, I let it serve as an example as to why it is important to take notes more immediately after trips while they are still fresh in my mind. With that said, please enjoy this piece.

### Saturday, December 3

- Sumi and I wake up very early for a flight from PHL - ORD. Sumi scheduled a Lyft the night before.
- Enjoy the ORD lounge food and take a photo for my [Epic Pass](https://www.epicpass.com/) during the layover.
- Catch my longest flight (FOOTNOTE: at the time, since then I have set a new PR from JFK to Taiwain, 17 hours) ever in my life to HND, Tokyo!

### Sunday, December 4

- If I recall correctly, Japan is 12 or 13 hours ahead of EST, so we landed around 4pm local time on Sunday
- Picked up by Tak (タクさん) in Tokyo, drive to Oyamadai.
- I meet Miki (みきさん, Sumi's mom), Saki (サキさん, Sumi's sister), Kaigo (かいごさん, Saki's boyfriend), and Lulu (ルル, Sumi's dog).
- I take a Japanese bath to wake up after the long flight.
- Miki prepares an incredible sushi dinner with a variety of fish and fresh sushi rice and we feast.
- Relatively early bed time.

### Monday, December 5

- Wake up early for Yoshi's bike tour!
- Yoshi shows us around Tokyo, including some popular shopping streets, historical sites, shrines, and the Imperial Palace!
- Lunch? TBD
- Head to Kaurizawa?
