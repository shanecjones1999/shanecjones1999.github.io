## Introduction

I was fortunate enough to travel to Hawaii from February 17-24. Before the trip, I thought of Hawaii as a pretty overhyped travel destination. I don't know what inspired me to have this opinion, but I don't agree with it now that I have seen it for myself.

The trip originally materialized in the Rally discord when Noah Newburger reached out about Kaimana Klassik, a casual frisbee tournament in Hawaii, in late 2023. I did not immediately make a firm commitment to go, but I was interested so I reacted to the message. Before I knew it, I found myself booking flights and preparing for the week long trip.
