*A Parting Note*\
It's a strange thing, the way time reveals a person's nature—not in grand moments of crisis, but in the quiet betrayals of schedules. The hour was set, agreed upon with the ease of a simple nod, yet when the moment arrived, it was met not with readiness, but with sleep.

There’s a lesson in that, though I wonder if it will be learned. Some people move through life as if time is a suggestion, not a structure. They drift, certain the world will wait, that others will cover for their absence, that departure times are more like rough estimates than agreed-upon commitments. And perhaps, for a while, they’re right.

But eventually, the world does leave without them. And by the time they wake, they find themselves alone, staring at a clock that kept moving even when they didn’t.

1. Jack upset Tommy for Lowest sense of urgency of the trip at Deep Creek 2023.
