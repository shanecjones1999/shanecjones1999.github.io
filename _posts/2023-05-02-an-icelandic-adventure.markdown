### Introduction

 In late November, 2022, I purchased a plane ticket to go to Iceland for two weeks starting in mid April. This was about a week before my departure for Japan, so it felt a little off to be planning _another_ two week international trip down the line. Furthmore, I hadn't confirmed with my work whether I'd be able to work remotely for two weeks, something I figured I'd do in an attempt to save my PTO after using it all and then some in Japan. Anyways, the tickets were purchased and an Airbnb was booked and now here we are, reminiscing on a great trip.

### **Day 1:** Arrive in Keflavík

Our plane landed at roughly 6:30 am after a 6 hour flight. I'd be shocked if I got _any_ sleep, but thankfully I wasn't too cranky in the morning. To kick off the trip, Sumi and I headed straight from the airport in Keflavík to the Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa famous for its milky blue, mineral-rich waters. Starting off with this was definitely the right move; it was relaxing but at the same time spurred excitement for the rest of the trip.

After visiting the Blue Lagoon, we took a bus to Reykjavík where our Airbnb host picked us up. Shortly after, we met up with our friend, Bethany, and we walked into the city for a meal. We were asleep by 9:00 pm that night.

### **Day 2:** Golden Circle Tour

Sunday morning our friend Susannah arrived. We began our morning at a cafe and eventually made our way into Reykjavík for a bit of exploring, but not too long because we needed to catch our bus tour of the [Golden Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland)). The tour guide's name was a traditional Icelandic one, and to save the troubles of foreignors attempting to pronounce it, he had us call him Frosty (after his father).

After finishing the tour, we cooked a seafood pasta dinner at home and promptly went to bed.

### **Days 3-7:** Explore Reykjavík

At this point in the trip, sadly, the weekend was over. It was time to work, although maybe slightly less than usual. We still had a variety of activities scattered throughout the week. Some of those activities included:

1. A walk over to [Reykjavík Röst](https://reykjavikrost.is/) for a coffee.
2. Visiting [a museum](https://www.phallus.is/).
3. Sandwiches for lunch from a bakery called [Bakabaka](https://www.bakabaka.is/).
4. Going to the pool.
5. Picking up food from the butcher.
6. Running.

During the weeknights, we visited a few different restaurants that I would recommend. The third night of the trip we went to [Seabaron](https://visitreykjavik.is/service/sea-baron) where I ordered their lobster soup. I recall that being one of the only items on the menu, and it was very good. On a later night, we went to [Old Iceland restaurant](https://oldiceland.is/) where I ordered a lamb ribeye, also very good. If you are traveling on a budget, there are "freedges" (free fridge) with free food! Though, I will say it is unclear how much food tourists should take, if any at all.

### **Days 8-10:** South Coast Camping Trip

For the middle weekend, we planned a camping trip along Iceland's south coast! We began our day renting a car and driving to a geothermal area with igneous rocks everywhere before heading to the main hike for the day. This was a 2 hour out-and-back hike with a warm stream we could enter at the summit! It was a very strange experience to change into my bathing suit in the frigid cold and then walk into a warm stream of water. The second day, we did another hike, but more notably went to the glacier lagoon known as [Jökulsárlón](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jökulsárlón). This is a bay area full of large chunks that have fallen off of the glacier [Vatnajökull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatnaj%C3%B6kull).

Returning from our camping trip, we visted a soup shop where we enjoyed soups in bread bowls with beer.

### **Days 11-16:** Explore Reykjavík More

In the second half of the trip, there was a bit of playing catch-up with work responsibilites, but we still managed to find time for some fun activities. Sumi and I got out on a number of runs, threw a Frisbee, and continued to walk around downtown Reykjavík.

Sumi and I enjoyed yet another very traditional Icelandic meal at [Messinn](https://www.messinn.com/en) were we ordered a seafood pasta and a fish pan. Iceland also has a banana ice cream that seems like a [Jersey Monkey](http://hoffmansicecream.net/flavors/) knockoff. While it wasn't as good as the real thing, it is impressive for a nation of less than 400,000.

### Final Thoughts

This was a really special trip and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to visit Iceland. It is an incredibly beautiful place and I would recommend anyone visit if they find themselves the chance.
