### Introduction

 In late November, 2022, I purchased a plane ticket to go to Iceland for two weeks starting in mid April. This was about a week before my departure for Japan, so it felt a little off to be planning _another_ two week international trip down the line. Also, I hadn't confirmed with my work whether I'd be able to work remotely for two weeks, something I figured I'd do in an attempt to save my PTO after using it all and then some in Japan. Anyways, the tickets were purchased and an Airbnb was booked and now here we are, reminiscing on a great trip.

### **Day 1:** Arrive in Keflavík

Our plane landed at roughly 6:30 am after a 6 hour flight. I'd be shocked to hear I got _any_ sleep, but thankfully I wasn't too cranky in the morning. To kick off the trip, Sumi and I headed straight from the airport in Keflavík to the Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa famous for its milky blue, mineral-rich waters. Starting off with this was definitely the right move; it was relaxing but at the same time spurred excitement for the rest of the trip.

After visiting the Blue Lagoon, we took a bus to Reykjavík where our Airbnb host picked us up. Shortly after, we met up with our friend, Bethany, and we walked into the city for a meal. We were asleep by 9:00 pm.

### **Day 2:** Golden Circle Tour

Sunday morning our friend Susannah arrived. We began our morning at a cafe and eventually made our way into Reykjavík for a bit of exploring, but not too long because we needed to catch our bus tour of the [Golden Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland)). The tour guide's name was a traditional Icelandic one, and to save the troubles of foreignors attempting to pronounce it, he had us call him Frosty (after his father).

After finishing the tour, we cooked a seafood pasta dinner at home and promptly went to bed.

### **Days 3-7:** Explore Reykjavík

At this point in the trip, sadly, the weekend was over. It was time to work, although maybe slightly less than usual. We still had a variety of activities scattered throughout the week. Some of those activities include:

1. A walk over to [Reykjavík Röst](https://reykjavikrost.is/) for a quick coffee.
2. Visiting [a museum](https://www.phallus.is/).
3. Sandwiches for lunch from a bakery called [Bakabaka](https://www.bakabaka.is/).
4. Going to the pool.
5. Picking up food from the butcher.
6. Running.

The third night of the trip we went to [Seabaron](https://visitreykjavik.is/service/sea-baron) where I ordered their Icelandic lobster soup!

Throughout Reykjavík there were "freedges" (free fridge) with free food!

### **Days 8-10:** South Coast Camping Trip

The best part of the trip! For the middle weekend, we planned a camping trip along Iceland's south coast! It was incredibly scenic. I'll let the photos do the talking here.

Safe to say we all slept well after returning from our excursion.

### **Days 11-16:** Explore Reykjavík More

In the second half of the trip, there was a bit of playing catch-up with work responsibilites, but we still managed to find time for some fun activities. Sumi and I got out on a number of runs, threw a Frisbee, and continued to walk around downtown Reykjavík.

Sumi and I enjoyed yet another very traditional Icelandic meal at [Messinn](https://www.messinn.com/en) were we ordered a seafood pasta and a fish pan.

Iceland's version of Jersey Monkey ice cream. While it wasn't as good as the real thing, it's impressive for a nation of less than 400,000.

### Final Thoughts

This was a really special trip and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to visit Iceland. I'd say a top 5 most naturally beautiful place I've ever been to and would absolutely recommend anyone visit if they find themselves the chance!
