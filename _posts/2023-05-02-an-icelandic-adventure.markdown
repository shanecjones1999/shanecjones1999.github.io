### Introduction

 In late November, 2022, I purchased a plane ticket to go to Iceland for two weeks starting in mid April. This was about a week before my departure for Japan, so it felt a little off to be planning _another_ two week international trip down the line. Also, I hadn't confirmed with my work whether I'd be able to work remotely for two weeks, something I figured I'd do in an attempt to save my PTO after using it all and then some in Japan. Anyways, the tickets were purchased and an Airbnb was booked and now here we are, reminiscing on a great trip.

### The Itinerary

While we made sure to leave lots of room for spontaneous activities, I'll leave a brief summary of the trip's agenda below.

#### Day 1-6: Explore Reykjav√≠k (Iceland's capital)

Activities: Sky Lagoon
