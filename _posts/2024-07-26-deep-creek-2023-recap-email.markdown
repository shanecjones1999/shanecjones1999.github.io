#### A concluding remark

Looking back at the summer of '23, Deep Creek weekend was undoubtedly my highlight. I want to give a huge thank you to the Lundy family for their generosity and hospitality. I'll have to begin planning for next year's trip! Until then, take care.

One more thing! I am missing quite a few emails, notably on the Lundy side, but also Marjorie on the Jones side. If you feel inspired, you can forward this to them. Thank you.

Most sincerely,\
Shane

#### Parting note

I would like to mention that some of the days started a bit later than desired. It appears that some of the cousins have adopted a rather peculiar habit of sleeping excessively, effectively transforming the vibrant destination of Deep Creek into what can only be dubbed "Sleep Creek." While I can appreciate the desire for relaxation and rest, the abundance of slumbering hours seems to overshadow the opportunities for exploration and engaging in enriching activities the locale has to offer. It is disheartening to witness the potential for bonding and shared experiences being overshadowed by their preference for a perpetual state of rest. Perhaps a gentle reminder, particularly aimed towards the Jones cousins, of the limited time we have together and the abundance of opportunities that await outside the realm of dreams would be beneficial in reinvigorating enthusiasm for all that Deep Creek has in store.
