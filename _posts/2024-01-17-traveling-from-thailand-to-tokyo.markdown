I recently traveled to Thailand and Japan with my partner Sumi and Becky and Gillie, two of our friends from Swarthmore. The trip took place from December 31 to January 15.

I was in Thailand through the 8th, where I spent 4 days in Chiang Mai and 3 days in Krabi. In Chiang Mai, we celebrated New Years, visited a national park, took care of elephants, and learned to cook Thai food. In Krabi, we experienced Thai beaches, kayaked with luminescent plankton, and scootered to a temple on a mountain.

On the 8th, we flew from Krabi to Bangkok to Tokyo, Japan. While in Japan, I spent 3 days in Tokyo, 2 days in Osaka, and 2 days in Kyoto. In Tokyo, I reconnected with Sumi's family, was reminded of how delicious Japanese food is, and unfortunately fell quite ill. In Osaka, we made a day trip to Kobe, visited an onsen, enjoyed a traditional okonomoyaki and yakisoba dinner, explored Osaka Castle, and played some games in Round1. In Kyoto, we tried matcha, explored Fushimi Inari Shrine, and ate classic Japanese food.

I would highly recommend traveling to both of these countries. You can find more specific trip details in the itinerary section below.

### Post-Trip Takeaways

- Traveling with a group is great, but keep in mind compatibility
  - The foods people eat (or cannot eat), what activites people enjoy, when people prefer to wake up
- Take time for yourself to recharge when needed
- Take plenty of photos to look back on later
- Be mindful of flavor fatigue
  - I enjoy eating food from countries outside of the one I am visiting
  - As an example, we had an Italian dinner in Osaka that was a nice break from the Japanese flavors
- Get a travel credit card to avoid international fees
- This is cliché, but try to push your comfort zone
