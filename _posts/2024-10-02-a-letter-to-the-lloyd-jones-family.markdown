This is a letter I wrote to the Lloyd-Jones family following a trip to Beaver Lake.

Dear Lloyd-Jones Family,

I am writing to give my gratitude for the generous graciousness you all have shown in hosting me at Beaver Lake over the September 14 weekend. What a fantastic trip we had! The charm of the lake never ceases to nonplus me.

It's been too long since I've touched base with the fam! Callie! Last I checked in, you were just beginning freshman year at Tufts- I hope sophomore year is off to a good start. Try your best to stay away from the infamous sophomore slump. Cam, I hope LA is treating you well. Keep up the good grades! Kath, I heard Don couldn't keep up with you on those ambitious hikes in Patagonia. Well done. I'll have to hear about that trip over a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon sometime soon! Don, congrats on the new job in Boston! Excited to have you all back on the east coast soon! And last and least, Adam! Thanks again for being such an excellent host. Enjoy your time back in Winnetka.

Much love,
Shane
